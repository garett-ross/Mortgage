This is a simple app to visualise behaviour of a mortgage over time.

User input specifying details of a mortgage are passed to a python script to calculate values over time,
which are returned to a plotly visual.

The app uses the Flask framework to receive input and render html. Graphing uses Plotly Graph Objects, and formatting uses Bootstrap.
